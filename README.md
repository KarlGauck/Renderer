# Renderer

This project is a renderer, written in OpenGL.
It uses premake as a build system.
Since I am not that familliar with premake, I used the following Github tutorial as a baseline:

https://github.com/premake/premake-core/wiki/Tutorial-Premake-example-with-GLFW-and-OpenGL

## Short term goals
- Simple Shader abstraction
- Basic 2D and 3D rendering
